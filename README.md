# SSIS 
SSIS-based ETL process that migrates data from a CSV file to a production SQL Server table

### ETL Process
  * Extract: created a comma separated value (.csv) file with data from a portable document (.pdf) file 
  * Transform: changed data types on a staging Table, as per the destination Table, and cleaned data (*deleted duplicate vaues, and discarded values that did not meet quality standards*)
  * Load: loaded data from a staging Table into a prod Table
  
### Error Handling
  * Researched error codes and adjusted SQL queries, step by step
  * Ran queries focusing on indivisual tasks (*e.g.: adjusted SQL expressions during transformation*)

### Challenges
  * Hardware limitations prevented me to run the latest version of SSMS
  * Time constrains due to prior commitments 

### Outcomes
  * Created a SSIS package to extract, transform, and load data into a production table
  * Enhanced my knowledge of SQL, Visual Studio 2022, and SQL Server Management Studio
